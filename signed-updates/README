Signed Update Utilities for Blob
--------------------------------

To create a signed update, first call build-signed-update.sh.  This will
create a pgp-signed virtual region data file.  Then, package the datafile
into a region update file using build-region.  This file must end with
".rgn" for the Windows updater.exe to accept it.  This file can then
be passed on the command line to the Windows updater.exe to update a unit.

bin2c is a simple program to convert binary data into a C array.  It can
be used to export a public key into blob.  Export the key to a file using
GPG, then use bin2c to generate a C array.  Add this to the pgp_public_keys.h
file.

The Makefile in this directory is for building the build-region program.
bin2c can be built directly.
